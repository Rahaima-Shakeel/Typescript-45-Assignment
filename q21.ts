// Q21 : They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

// creating object
let personalInfo = {
    name : "Rahaima",
    age : 23,
    occupation : "Biomedical Engineer"
};

// printing the personalInfo object
console.log (personalInfo);
